🧾 Receipts — Merchant Pitch

One‑line pitch

Instant, tamper‑proof digital receipts delivered to Apple Wallet & Google Pay — no paper, no friction, no fraud.

⸻

The problem

Paper receipts are a hidden operational cost.

For merchants, they mean:
	•	Ongoing spend on printers, rolls, ink, and maintenance
	•	Slower checkout times at busy periods
	•	Staff time wasted handling lost‑receipt disputes
	•	Easy fraud via screenshots, edits, or duplicated receipts

For customers, they mean clutter, lost proof of purchase, and friction during returns.

⸻

The solution

Receipts replaces paper receipts entirely with secure, wallet‑native receipts that appear on a customer’s phone automatically as soon as a contactless payment succeeds.

No scanning.
No emails.
No apps to install.

Payment → Receipt. Done.
