🔐 Receipts — Security & Integrity

This document outlines how Receipts ensures authenticity, integrity, and trust for digital receipts.

Receipts are designed to function as records of truth, equivalent (or superior) to traditional paper receipts.

⸻

Security goals

Receipts is built to ensure that:
	•	Receipts cannot be altered or forged
	•	Merchants can verify receipts instantly
	•	Customers cannot manipulate receipts via screenshots or edits
	•	Sensitive payment data is never exposed

⸻

Tamper‑proof by design

Every receipt generated by Receipts is:
	•	Created server‑side
	•	Digitally signed
	•	Bound to a specific merchant and transaction

This means the receipt’s data cannot be changed without invalidating its signature.

Screenshots, PDFs, or modified images are not valid receipts.

⸻

Digital signatures

Each receipt includes:
	•	A unique receipt ID
	•	A cryptographic signature generated using merchant‑scoped keys
	•	A checksum of all critical receipt fields (amount, timestamp, merchant, items)

At verification time:
	1.	Receipt ID is scanned
	2.	Server recalculates the checksum
	3.	Signature is validated
	4.	Receipt is confirmed as authentic or rejected

⸻

Wallet‑native verification

Receipts are issued as native:
	•	Apple Wallet passes
	•	Google Wallet passes

Verification relies on:
	•	Pass serial numbers
	•	Wallet issuer validation
	•	Server‑side receipt records

This prevents:
	•	Manual editing
	•	Duplicate reuse
	•	Screenshot‑based fraud

⸻

Return & refund protection

When a receipt is used for a return:
	•	Staff scan the wallet barcode / QR
	•	Receipts API validates authenticity
	•	Transaction status is confirmed in real time

If a refund is issued:
	•	The receipt is updated
	•	Wallet pass status changes (e.g. “Refunded”)
	•	Duplicate returns are prevented

⸻

Payment data safety

Receipts never stores sensitive card data.
	•	No PAN storage
	•	No CVV
	•	No expiry dates

Stored payment references are limited to:
	•	Token identifiers from payment providers
	•	Last‑4 digits (display only)

This keeps Receipts out of PCI scope for raw card handling.

⸻

Encryption
	•	In transit: TLS 1.2+
	•	At rest: AES‑256 encryption
	•	Keys: Managed via secure key management systems

Merchant data is logically isolated.

⸻

Access control
	•	Role‑based access control (RBAC)
	•	Merchant‑scoped API keys
	•	Least‑privilege service permissions
	•	Optional IP allowlisting for APIs

⸻

Auditability

Receipts maintains:
	•	Immutable audit logs for receipt creation, access, and refunds
	•	Timestamped records for compliance and dispute resolution
	•	Clear traceability between receipt, merchant, and transaction

⸻

Data integrity over time

Even during long retention periods:
	•	Receipt data remains verifiable
	•	Signatures can be revalidated
	•	Historical records remain trustworthy

Anonymisation never compromises receipt authenticity.

⸻

Summary

Receipts is built so that:
	•	A receipt is either valid or invalid — never ambiguous
	•	Merchants can trust receipts without manual checks
	•	Customers benefit from instant, secure proof of purchase

Security is not an add‑on. It is the foundation.
